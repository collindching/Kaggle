This project was based off of the [Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) from Kaggle. The data was too big for me to upload to Github, but you can download from the competition. I worked on this after the competition ended and used it as an opportunity to learn about feature engineering and tuning models. 

My code is split into different scripts within workflow, and I numbered them in the order that I ran them. I split the code I used to work on my Home Credit models into different scripts.
