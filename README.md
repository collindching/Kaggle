# Home Credit Default Risk

Given a person's credit history, can you predict whether that person will pay back a current loan? This project was based off of the [Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) from Kaggle. I worked on this after the competition ended and used it as an opportunity to put some machine learning into practice and learn about feature engineering model tuning.

## How to run the code

The data was too big for me to upload to Github, but you can download from the competition. 

My code is split into different scripts within the workflow folder, and I numbered them in the order that I ran them. You can run all the scripts in that order. I also split up my Home Credit models in different scripts.
